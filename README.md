# StdUtils
A group of functions that are mostly used in the embedded space for calculations and functionality that is needed on an embedded type
of system.

This project was first started using Code Blocks.  The main reason for using code blocks is that most embedded develoment is done using
Windows platforms with some kind of tools environment (Keil, IAR) and many others.  Code Blocks is a free IDE that can be used along with
other IDE tools for prototyping functions and testing fuctions before going into an embedded system.  The standare utilities (StUdUtils)
used the advise and direction of some embedded guru's.   Not all will agree with implementation. Implementation is done with debugging
in mind.  

There is a simple way to test the functions that put into the standard utilities.  The test files are light weight and 
are added so that testing of the functions will be easy to understand and fast.  

There are many other functions that can be added.  The testing is bit on the light side right now.  

I have not found something similar on GitHub, it may exists.  Also there may be a better and faster way.  Please keep comments
constructive.
