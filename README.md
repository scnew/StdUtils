# StdUtils
A group of functions that are mostly used in the embedded space for calculations and functionality that is needed on an embedded type
of system.

Standard utilities (StUdUtils) uses the advise and direction of good coding practices that have been written about by many experts.  
Not all developers agree with the experts.  My assumption is during bug hunts and many years of coding the experts suggest things that 
may save time in the longer run of code debugging and maintenance.  Implementation is done with debugging and testing in mind.  
This approach will avoid suttle problemsthat can crop up when the complexities of alogrithms are being debugged.

There is a simple way to test the functions.  After searching for something that is very portable over different compliers and IDEs the unity test
library was chosen testing standard.  Using a standard library that is portable over most platforms and compliers encourages test standards into
project. As I have heard many times, exhaustive testing is something that is not feasible.  Tests 
can have many objectives.  For now due to a lack a structured requirements for the project tests are simple and rather straight forward.

I have not found something similar on GitHub, it may exists.  Also there may be a better and faster way.  Please keep comments
constructive.
